This web application is written to automate site migration (html, css, js*) to Esp8266.
Insert your html code and click "convert", your code will remove line breaks and _"_ will be replaced with _\"_.
In the same way, you can convert styles and JavaScript.
!Important, your JavaScript should not have comments like: "//comment", otherwise when deleting the line breaks the first comment will cut off all further code.
